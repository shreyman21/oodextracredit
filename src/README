Overview:
The Event Planner Application is designed to manage and automate the scheduling of events for
users. The purpose is to create a schedule that avoids overlapping events by creating an easier
way to create, modify, remove, and view events. Some background knowledge needed are basic
knowledge of event planning and common scheduling terms such as start and end time. The
extensibility envisioned focuses on adding more complex scheduling features in the future but it
currently focuses on basic event management and schedule automation.


Quick Start:
To get started with the Event Planner Application, you first need to create a User and an Event.
An example is shown below:
User user = new User("1", "John Doe");
Event event = new Event("Meeting", LocalDateTime.now(), LocalDateTime.now().plusHours(1),
                        "Conference Room", false, new ArrayList<>(), new ArrayList<>());
user.getSchedule().addEvent(event);

This snippet demonstrates how to create a user, create an event, and add the event to the user's
schedule.


Key Components and Subcomponents:
- plannerSystem
  The plannerSystem is the main component for managing users and their events. It provides the
  core functions for scheduling events, including uploading schedules from XML files, saving
  schedules, and performing other main functions like creating, modifying, removing, and
  auto-scheduling events. It interfaces with all other components to ensure smooth operation of
  the application.

- Event:
This component represents a scheduled event, with details such as event name, start and end times,
location, and whether it's online or in-person.

- User:
This component is for user details and their schedule. Each user has a unique ID and a name,
along with a Schedule object that holds their events.

- Schedule:
This component is a collection of Event objects. It provides methods to add, remove,
and list events.

- Utils:
This component has the utility methods for reading from and writing to XML files, and other
utility operations that support the main functionalities of the application.

- textualView:
This component is used to display the schedules of each user in a readable format. It formats the
event details and schedules into the appropriate output. It the provides the name, time, location,
online status, and invitees, making it easier for users to understand their schedules at a glance.


Source Organization:
The codebase is organized into the model package:
/model/User.java: Defines the User class with user details and schedule.
/model/Event.java: Represents individual events.
/model/Schedule.java: Manages a collection of events for a user.
/model/plannerSystem.java: Core system for managing users and their events.
/model/plannerSystemModel.java: Interface defining the operations supported by the planner system.

There is also the view package which contains the textualView:
/view/textualView.java: Implements the plannerView interface to display users' schedules in a text
format. It formats and prints schedule and event details to the console in a specific format.

The test package contains the tests for the other packages:
/test/model/: Contains unit tests for classes within the model package, ensuring that the
logic and data models behave as expected as well as tests for edge cases.

/test/view/: Contains tests for the textualView class, verifying that the presentation
layer correctly formats and displays data.

Class Invariance:
User: The user ID and name are immutable and unique. Every User in the plannerSystem must have
a unique identifier. This ensures that no two users can have the same ID, preserving the integrity
of user data and schedules.

CHANGES FOR PART 2:
We noticed a functionality that we needed to utilize was missing from our system which was the
ability to retrieve and compile a list of events form all users' schedules. In many applications,
there's a need to view or analyze events across multiple schedules including finding a common
time slot or a comprehensive event timeline. To address this, we made a method called getEvents
in the PlannerSystem class.
It initializes an empty list of events and then iterates over a collection of user objects. For
each user, it retrieves the users' schedule and adds all th events from the schedule to the initial
list. The method returns the list of all the events that are scheduled across the system.

New Classes:
- EventFrame:
This class is used to represent a GUI frame that is specifically designed for creating, modifying,
or removing events within the planner system.

- MainSystemFrame
This class is the main frame for the planner system's GUI. It initializes and displays the main
components of the system such as the menu bars and the buttons for creating and scheduling events.

New Interfaces:
- IEventPanelView
This interface is intended to have the requirements for the a view component that is used to display
event details within a panel.

- IEventView
This interface is intended to serve as a contract to create views that display or interact with
the event data.

- IMainSystemView
This interface is intended to outline the structure and functionality required for the main view of
the system.

- IScheduleView
This interface is intended to define the necessary parts of the view component that displays
schedules.


Changes to Part 3:
We realized that there needed to be an interface for the strategies so we added an interface and
created the AnytimeSchedulingStrategy and WorkHoursSchedulingStrategy classes. This is to help
separate and organize these strategies to be called on and use later on more easily and for easier
code readability. We also mad a method called createEventBasedOnStrategy in the planner system and
the interface to more easily create events for specific strategies. Finally, we added a parameter to
the PlannerSystem class which was the scheduling strategy so that a strategy could be associated
with the schedule. We added two new methods to accompany this as well:

New Methods:
- setSchedulingStrategy:
A method that allows the dynamic setting of a scheduling strategy according to user choices

- scheduleEventForUser:
A method that schedules an event for a user and utilizes the currently set scheduling strategy


New Interfaces:
- IPlannerView:
This interface is a general contract for the planner's view component and gives them a way to update
the schedule display and set listeners for user actions.

- SchedulingStrategy:
Defines a strategy pattern that allows the implementation of different scheduling algorithms that
can be specifically chosen and applied.

- IScheduleView:
Intended interface for views that deal with displaying schedules and distinguishing them from other
types of views within the application

- PlannerViewListener:
An interface to define callbacks for user actions captured by the view components,
which are then handled by the PlannerController.


New Classes:
- AnytimeSchedulingStrategy:
Implementation of the SchedulingStrategy interface. A specific logic to schedule events at any
available time

- WorkHoursSchedulingStrategy:
Implementation of the SchedulingStrategy interface. A specific logic to schedule events within
standard work hours.

- SearchingStrategy:
Class that is utilized within the scheduling strategies to find suitable time slots for events based
on the criteria. It has the logic that iterates through the possible times and checks availability.

- Planner Controller:
Acts as a controller for the planner application. It manages the flow of data between the Model and
View by handling user inputs and responding to Model updates. It ensures the UI reflects the current
state of the application.

- MockPlannerView:
A mock implementation of the IPlannerView interface used for testing purposes to simulate the view's
behavior without requiring the full graphical interface.

- SchedulingFrame:
A JFrame subclass that provides a GUI for scheduling events. It works with PlannerSystem to assign
scheduling strategies and update event details.

- MainSystemView:
This is the primary view of the the graphical interface for the planner system.

- PlannerViewTextual:
This is a textual representation of the planner dates.
